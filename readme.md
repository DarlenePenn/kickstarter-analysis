# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this analysis is to examine the outcomes of Theater Kickstarter campaigns to find trends in their outcomes in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. This will allow the client Louise to make informed decisions about her own kickstarter campaign.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The first difficulty I encountered was with creating the Outcomes "Based on Goals Chart".  I initially tried to create a Pivot Chart from a Pivot table of the entire dataset on that sheet.  However after moving the parameters back and forth, from axis to legend to value, nothing seemed to capture the data as it needed to be displayed for the challenge. I overcame this by deleting the pivot table, and creating the chart from only the columns I needed, instead of the entire data set. A few other challenges I had with this assignment were mostly formatting issues.  

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- - The best time to launch a kickstarter campaign for a play is Q2, around May or June. These are the months with the hightest number of successful campaigns. 
- - It is not a good idea to launch a campaign in October, since more campaigns failed when they were launched during this month.  It may be due to the upcoming holiday season

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- -She should keep her campaign goal under $5,000 to increase the likelihood of having a successful campaign.  A good percentage of successful kickstarters for plays were less than $5,000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- -This dataset only captures fundraising on one platform (Kickstarter). There are other online fundraising sites that are not included, like GoFundMe, etc.  There are also many fundraisers that may be done strictly in-person and not online at all.  The data from those campaigns would not be captured in this dataset.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- -We could look at the duration of the campaign to see how the length of time influenced the outcome, using a line chart.  We could also create a table to examine how the number of backers a campaign had helped or prevented it from meeting its goal.
