# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this analysis is to examine the outcomes of Theater Kickstarter campaigns to find trends in their outcomes in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. This will allow the client Louise to make informed decisions about her own kickstarter campaign.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The first difficulty I encountered was with creating the Outcomes "Based on Goals Chart".  I initially tried to create a Pivot Chart from a Pivot table of the entire dataset on that sheet.  However after moving the parameters back and forth, from axis to legend to value, nothing seemed to capture the data as it needed to be displayed for the challenge. I overcame this by deleting the pivot table, and creating the chart from only the columns I needed, instead of the entire data set. A few other challenges I had with this assignment were mostly formatting issues.  

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
